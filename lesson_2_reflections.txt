What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository, a .git (hidden) file gets added which keeps all the commit records and metadata of the repository.
We need to do it because we need those commit records so that we can arrive to this point in future in case of any condition.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is just the collection of files while the staging area is the area where files are added to be tracked
by git. Repository is a place where i think all the data, the files and the .git file which contains data about data, and history is stored.
The value it offers: It tracks the untracked files by Git which can later be commit to store a commit point in Git  log.
